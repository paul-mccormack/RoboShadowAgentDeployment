# Introduction

RoboShadow is a cloud hosted cyber security platform offering external vulnerabiltiy scanning, device attack surface management, MFA auditing and 365 AD Sync.  You can find out more at [RoboShadow.com](https://www.roboshadow.com/)

RoboShadow provides an installable agent for monitoring your devices. This is very simple to install using the downloadable msi file, a PowerShell script provided by RoboShadow, which can be found [here](https://github.com/paul-mccormack/RoboShadowAgentDeployment/blob/main/RoboShadowAgentInstall.ps1), or if you have Microsoft Intune within your organisation you can utilise the very handy "Deploy RoboShadow With Intune" once you have integration set-up completed.  Detailed guidance is available in their [documention](https://roboshadow.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Roboshadow/overview?homepageId=4882647)
